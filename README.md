# Self-Organizing Cells in React

This project is an exploration into self-organizing behavior within React components, based on the classic cellular automata of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). The aim is to create a simulation where React components exhibit autonomous interactions and decision-making based on their surroundings.

In this project, we'll be exploring how React components can simulate self-organizing behavior by perceiving and interacting with their neighboring components. Along the way we hope to delve into the principles of causality and information propagation, and see what sort of parallels we can draw with concepts from philosophy and physics.
